                        <p class="my-3">Pop music is the genre of popular music that produces the most hits. A hit is a
                            song that sells many copies, and the latest hits are listed every week on the charts. To get
                            on the charts, a song must be released as a single, although most singles are also released
                            on an album. Songs that become hits almost always share certain features that are sometimes
                            called the pop-music formula. They have a good rhythm, a catchy melody, and are easy to
                            remember and sing along to. They usually have a chorus that's repeated several times and two
                            or more verses. Most pop songs are between two and five minutes long, and the lyrics are
                            usually about the joys and problems of love and relationships. Some of my favorite Pop song
                            producer including The Weeknd, Pop Malone and the late 90's pop star Micheal Jackson.</p>

                                        Pop", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th
                                        century. During his four-decade career, his contributions to music, dance, and

                                        as the moonwalk, which he named, as well as the robot.</p>
